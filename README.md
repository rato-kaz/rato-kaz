### What I do
- Design, train, and ship ML models end-to-end
- Productionize inference APIs and data pipelines
- Balance research prototypes with real-world constraints

### Now
- Refining model serving patterns (batch vs realtime, streaming)
- Evaluating prompt+retrieval strategies for stability over time
- Tidying internal tooling for faster experiments

### Focus areas
- NLP, information retrieval, and evaluation
- Computer vision for document and scene understanding
- MLOps: observability, rollouts, drift and cost control

### Stack
`Python` · `TensorFlow` · `FastAPI` · `Docker` · `NLP` · `Computer Vision`

### Principles
- Prefer simple, observable systems over fragile, complex ones
- Measure first, optimize second; keep an eye on tail latencies
- Small, frequent improvements beat large, infrequent rewrites

### Selected work
- To be updated later
